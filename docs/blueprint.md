# **App Name**: VectorFlow

## Core Features:

- Node Creation: Allow users to create nodes on the ReactFlow canvas with customizable properties.
- Edge Connection: Enable users to connect nodes with edges, defining relationships between them.
- Canvas Manipulation: Provide pan and zoom functionality for easy navigation of complex graphs.
- Layout Arrangement: Use generative AI to determine the ideal positions for the different elements. An AI tool will consider various layouts and optimize based on readability, visual balance, and connection density.
- Node Styling: Offer options to customize the appearance of nodes (colors, shapes, sizes).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #739072 (RGB) - A calm, muted green to suggest connectivity and growth without distraction.
- Background color: #E4E9E3 (RGB) - A very light desaturated green-gray, providing a soft, neutral backdrop that allows the nodes and connections to stand out.
- Accent color: #A9B388 (RGB) - A slightly brighter and more saturated green than the primary color, used sparingly to draw attention to important elements or interactive components.
- Font: 'Inter' - A sans-serif font, appropriate for both headline and body text due to its modern, neutral, and readable appearance. This font ensures that all textual information within the app is easily accessible.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent different node types or actions. These icons should be easily recognizable and consistent with the overall visual style of the application.
- Employ a clean and intuitive layout that allows users to easily create and manipulate nodes and connections. Prioritize visual clarity and minimize distractions.
- Incorporate subtle animations for node creation, connection, and highlighting to provide visual feedback and enhance the user experience.
